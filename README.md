# micromix_relayer

Relayer + relayer registry contract. These are designed generally, to accomodate any application requiring
transaction abstraction, but are initially being developed for [micromix](https://github.com/weijiekoh/mixer).

## TODO
Right now, experimenting with js and python for a relayer implementation. Will converge on one based on
technical requirements and possibilities with each language.
